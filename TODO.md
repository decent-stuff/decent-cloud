- add support for sending emails by the API backend, using mailchannels.com (I already have an API key for them)
- add support for payments with Stripe, I have a Stripe account and API keys already
- improve search support, if possible add a minimal search DSL for filtering results, e.g. like on ServerHunter https://www.serverhunter.com/#query=stock:(in_stock+OR+unknown)
- improve reputation display on profiles:
    - how quickly they respond to requests
    - percentage of contracts that get canceled by users within 1h/24h/7d
    - how many successful transactions they have completed
    - how many disputes they have had
    - how many positive/negative reviews they have received
    - do they have verified identity, email, phone number, payment methods, etc
    - warn if account is new and has little history
- Password/account recovery through emails: send account recovery links via email and allow users to recovery access to  their accounts that way
- Admin UI with support for:
    - sending test and other emails
    - performing actions in the name of other users (impersonating)

## Provider Provisioning Agent

**Spec:** [2025-12-07-provider-provisioning-agent-spec.md](docs/2025-12-07-provider-provisioning-agent-spec.md)
**Status:** MVP complete through Phase 7 (Credential Encryption)

- Phase 8: Hetzner Cloud provisioner
- Phase 9: Docker, DigitalOcean, Vultr provisioners

---

## Provider Trust & Reliability System

### Service Quality Verification
- Automated health checks on provisioned services
- Uptime monitoring and SLA compliance tracking

---

## Notification System

### Paid Notification Tiers
- Define pricing for additional notifications beyond free tier
- Integrate with payment system (Stripe/ICPay)
- Track paid quota separately from free tier

---

## ICPay Integration

### Manual Payout Requirement
**ICPay does NOT have a programmatic payout API.** Provider payouts must be done manually:
1. View pending releases: `GET /api/v1/admin/payment-releases`
2. Create payouts in icpay.org dashboard (Payouts section)
3. Mark as paid: `POST /api/v1/admin/payouts`

### Future: Automated Payouts
To automate payouts, implement direct ICRC-1 transfers from platform wallet using `ic-agent`.

## Rental State Machine

### Remaining (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Contract archival** - Old contracts stay in DB indefinitely

---

## Architectural Issues Requiring Review

### Open Issues

#### 10. Hardcoded Token Value ($1 USD)

**Issue:** Token USD value hardcoded instead of fetched from exchanges.

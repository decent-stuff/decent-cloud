# TODO

**Specs:**
- [docs/specs/2026-02-14-decent-recipes.md](docs/specs/2026-02-14-decent-recipes.md)
- [docs/specs/2026-02-14-self-provisioning-platform.md](docs/specs/2026-02-14-self-provisioning-platform.md) — Phases 1-4 complete (marketplace listing flow implemented).

## Cloud Provisioning

### Known Limitations

- **Multi-instance race** — If two API server instances share the same DB, both provisioning services race on the same resources. The 10-minute lock timeout prevents corruption but can cause delayed provisioning or double-attempt waste. *(Not a prod issue if only one instance runs. Only matters at scale.)*

### Remaining

- **Marketplace billing for listed resources** — Platform fee for marketplace-listed self-provisioned resources. *(Blocked: needs product decisions on fee structure.)*
- **Marketplace rental fulfillment for self-provisioned** — When a tenant rents a self-provisioned offering, the contract is created but the VM access handoff (credential sharing) is manual. Needs: automated credential sharing mechanism, stock tracking (one VM = stock of 1). *(Blocked: needs billing decisions first.)*

### Remaining (Recipes)

- **Recipe script versioning** — Scripts are snapshotted at contract creation. Consider a `recipe_versions` table so authors can update scripts and buyers can opt-in to upgrades. *(Multi-week: new DB table, migration logic, UI for version management.)*
- **Recipe validation / dry-run** — No way to test a recipe without creating a real contract. Consider: syntax check (shellcheck), dry-run mode that provisions a VM, runs the script, reports results, and tears down. *(Multi-session: needs a dedicated test-run flow distinct from purchase.)*
- **Standalone recipe entity** — Recipes are currently a text field on offerings. A `recipes` table would enable: reuse across multiple offerings, community browsing/forking, ratings, and independent authorship. *(Architectural change — needs design discussion.)*

## Provider Provisioning Agent (dc-agent)

**Spec:** [2025-12-07-provider-provisioning-agent-spec.md](docs/2025-12-07-provider-provisioning-agent-spec.md)
**Status:** MVP complete through Phase 8 (Hetzner server-side in api-server via `HetznerBackend`). Health check scheduling wired up in dc-agent main loop.

- Phase 9: Docker, DigitalOcean, Vultr provisioners *(Multi-week epic: each provisioner is a separate CloudBackend impl + credentials + testing.)*

---

## Provider Trust & Reliability System

DB tables (`contract_health_checks`), API endpoints, and automated health check scheduling in dc-agent are implemented.

- SLA compliance tracking and provider reputation scoring *(Blocked: needs product decisions on SLA metrics, scoring formula, how reputation affects discovery. Single-session once decisions are made.)*

---

## Notification System

### Paid Notification Tiers
- Define pricing for additional notifications beyond free tier
- Integrate with payment system (Stripe/ICPay)
- Track paid quota separately from free tier

*(Blocked: needs product decisions on pricing tiers before implementation. Multi-session: DB schema, Stripe integration, quota tracking.)*

---

## ICPay Integration

### Future: Automated Payouts
ICPay does not have a programmatic payout API. Currently payouts are manual via `GET /api/v1/admin/payment-releases` + icpay.org dashboard + `POST /api/v1/admin/payouts`. Implement direct ICRC-1 transfers from platform wallet using `ic-agent` when ICPay adds payout API support. *(Blocked on ICPay adding payout API.)*

---

## Architectural Issues Requiring Review

### Hardcoded Token Value ($1 USD)

**Issue:** Token USD value hardcoded instead of fetched from exchanges.
**Location:** `ic-canister/src/canister_backend/generic.rs:75-78`
**FIXME in code:** `refresh_last_token_value_usd_e6()` always returns `1_000_000` ($1 USD). Needs ICPSwap/KongSwap integration. *(Blocked on choosing exchange API. Single-session once decided.)*

---

## Code Quality

### Test Coverage Gaps

- **OpenAPI endpoint handlers** — 15 files (~10K lines) in `api/src/openapi/` have limited or no tests: providers.rs, contracts.rs, cloud.rs, accounts.rs, admin.rs, chatwoot.rs, invoices.rs, offerings.rs, resellers.rs, stats.rs, subscriptions.rs, system.rs, transfers.rs, users.rs, validators.rs. (4 files have tests: agents.rs, vat.rs, webhooks.rs, common.rs.) *(Multi-week: each file needs integration test setup with DB fixtures.)*

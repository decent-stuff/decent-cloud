    that&apos;s shaking up the cloud oligopoly by enabling peer-to-peer resource sharing. Say goodbye to steep pricing and
    those pesky region-wide outages!<br/><br/>
    <strong>Key highlights:</strong><br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Provider reputations and reviews tracked in tamper-proof ledger<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ No gatekeepers or central control, completely permissionless<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Self-sustaining with minimal fees<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Community-driven evolution`

    <strong>Earning Reputation:</strong><br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Reputation is earned through successful transactions between developers and node providers<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ When a developer pays a provider, both parties gain a small reputation boost<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ All reputation changes are recorded transparently on the blockchain<br/><br/>
    <strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Reputation is a valuable asset that takes time to build<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Disputes cost reputation for both parties, discouraging frivolous claims<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ The system promotes high standards of conduct and service quality<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Blockchain ensures tamper-resistance and transparent verification`

    1. Acquire DCT tokens (from peers or a DEX such as Kong)<br/>
    2. Run <code>dc np check-in</code> with your identity<br/>
    3. Get rewarded with block rewards<br/><br/>
    <strong>Quick facts:</strong><br/>
    ‚Ä¢ 50 DCT initial block reward<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Unclaimed rewards are carried over to the next block<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ New block every 10 minutes<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Reward halves every 210,000 blocks<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ Total supply: ~21M DCT`

        icon: "üí∞",
        content: `It's actually safer than other marketplaces. Rather than relying on a behind-the-scenes database, all financial transactions are recorded on the blockchain, so there is no possibility of a fraud or a rug pull. Fees are paid in Decentralized Cloud Token (DCT), and conversion is automatic. What drives the value of DCT:<br/><br/>
    ‚Ä¢ <strong>Demand:</strong> All fees are paid in DCT. In addition, DCT can be used to pay for renting services or resources<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ <strong>Supply:</strong> DC tokens can be acquired by renting services or resources, or by mining/validating<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ <strong>Governance:</strong> Platform is permissionless and DAO-controlled, so all decisions are made by the community<br/>
    ‚Ä¢ <strong>Open Source:</strong> Anyone can contribute to the project, or fork it and start their own Decent Cloud.

**Decent Cloud: Empowering Decentralized Resource Sharing**

Decent Cloud is building a next-generation, decentralized platform for renting and leasing computing resources—ranging from **GPUs and specialized ML/LLM services** to full cloud solutions—all accessed through a single, user-friendly interface. By leveraging a tamper-proof blockchain ledger, Decent Cloud eliminates vendor lock-in, ensures transparent transactions, and delivers a robust reputation system that cannot be easily replicated using centralized databases.

### Why Blockchain is Necessary Here

- **Tamper-Proof Reputation Tracking**
  Reputation in Decent Cloud is directly linked to paid transactions, making it rare and highly valuable. The transparent, immutable nature of blockchain guarantees that no single party can falsify or manipulate the ledger, ensuring that reputation genuinely reflects a participant’s track record.

- **Decentralized Trust**
  The platform’s credibility doesn’t rely on any single organization. Every node provider and user helps verify the ledger. This shared trust model is especially critical in a marketplace where providers set their own prices and reputations must remain indisputable.

- **Immutable Records**
  Traditional databases can be edited or tampered with. Blockchain provides an unalterable history of service fees and performance, allowing users to make informed decisions based on verifiable data.

### Unique Differentiators

1. **Flexible Resource Offerings**
   Rent high-performance GPUs for machine learning workloads, easily scale LLM (Large Language Model) services for inference or training, or access standard cloud resources. Providers can monetize these specialized services, meeting the growing demand for AI and ML infrastructure.

2. **Hard-Earned Reputation**
   Only paying transaction fees can boost a provider’s or developer’s standing. This makes it expensive (in both time and resources) to build a strong, positive reputation—and easy to lose it with poor service.

3. **Eco-Friendly Validation**
   Decent Cloud employs a low-energy validation approach. Instead of Proof of Work, a proof-of-ledger-possession is used, ensuring transparency without massive energy costs.

4. **Highly Experienced R&D Team**
   Nearly 10 developers, with strong backgrounds in distributed computing, cryptography, and software engineering, have produced a working MVP backend deployed on the Internet Computer. An easy-to-use in-browser client and dashboard are in progress, placing Decent Cloud on track to completion within a few months and an official launch in 6–12 months—provided adequate funding.

5. **Open Source Advantage**
   Full transparency invites community contributions, accelerates innovation, and builds trust among providers and users alike. This approach helps ensure security and scalability.

### Funding & Next Steps

- **Target Initial Raise**: **$1M–$3M**

  - Finalize MVP and UI/UX tools
  - Expand development team and conduct robust security audits
  - Boost community-building, marketing, and provider outreach

- **Projected Timeline**:

  - **MVP Completion**: A few months
  - **Official Launch**: 6–12 months

This unique, blockchain-driven marketplace can’t be replicated with traditional centralized solutions. Its capacity to seamlessly offer specialized ML, GPU, and LLM resources—while tying reputation to immutable, fee-based transactions—positions Decent Cloud as a cutting-edge alternative in the global cloud market.

### Reputation Building in Decent Cloud

Decent Cloud’s reputation system promotes trust by tying reputation directly to real-world transactions:

1. **Earning Reputation**
   When a developer pays a node provider, the node provider is charged a 2% fee, and a portion of that fee funds further research and development. Both parties then gain a small reputation boost. In other words, consistent, successful transactions are the only way to build trust in the network.

2. **Public and Transparent**
   All reputation changes are recorded in smart contracts on a blockchain. This creates a transparent history that anyone can review, making it straightforward to distinguish reliable participants from less reputable ones.

3. **Reputation as a Valuable Asset**
   Reputation takes time, quality service, and consistent transactions to earn. It can also be spent to penalize others for poor service. Spending reputation lowers both parties’ scores—an intentionally costly action that discourages frivolous disputes. This ensures that disputes are raised sparingly and only when truly justified.

4. **High Standards of Conduct**
   Because reputation is intimately tied to real payments and visible to all, developers and node providers are motivated to maintain a high level of service and integrity. This system rewards honesty and discourages dishonest or malicious behavior.

### Why Use a Blockchain?

Decent Cloud uses a blockchain to store reputation data for the following indisputable reasons:

1. **Tamper-Resistance**
   A blockchain’s distributed ledger makes it extremely difficult for any single party to alter or erase past transactions. This ensures the historical integrity of reputation scores.

2. **Decentralized Trust**
   No central authority controls the ledger. Instead, a network of independent nodes collectively validates every reputation change. This prevents manipulation by any one person or organization.

3. **Transparent Verification**
   Every transaction and reputation update is visible to all participants. This openness makes it simple to verify claims about a participant’s credibility without having to rely on a private or closed database.

By combining these blockchain benefits with a clear, transaction-based reputation model, Decent Cloud fosters an environment of accountability, trust, and fairness for all participants.

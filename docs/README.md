## üåü Key Concepts

### Reputation System

Our [reputation system](reputation.md) is the cornerstone of trust in Decent Cloud. It ensures:

- Transparent, blockchain-based trust
- Incentives for honest behavior
- Protection against bad actors

### Validation

[Validation](mining-and-validation.md) is how we maintain our decentralized ledger:

- Energy-efficient consensus
- Equal reward distribution
- Tamper-proof transaction history

### Token Economics

Our [token distribution](token-distribution.md) model is designed for:

- Sustainable growth
- Fair participation rewards
- Balanced incentives

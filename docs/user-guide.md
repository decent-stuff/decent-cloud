# User Guide

This guide covers everything you need to know about using the Decent Cloud platform as a user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Completed [installation](installation.md)
- Generated identity and registered account
- Initial DC tokens for operations

### Registration

```bash
dc user register --identity my-user
```

## Finding Resources

### Listing All Offerings

```bash
dc offering list
```

### Searching Specific Offerings

Use the query command with specific criteria:

```bash
dc offering query 'memory >= 512MB AND storage.size > 1gb'
```

Common search criteria:

- Memory: `memory >= <size>`
- Storage: `storage.size > <size>`
- CPU: `cpu.cores >= <number>`
- Location: `location == "<region>"`

### Understanding Offerings

Key aspects to consider:

1. Resource specifications
2. Provider reputation
3. Pricing
4. Location
5. Terms of service

## Contracting Resources

### Preparing for Contract

1. Review provider's profile and history:

```bash
dc np list --balances
```

2. Ensure sufficient token balance
3. Prepare SSH public key
4. Have contact information ready

### Creating a Contract Request

Basic contract request:

```bash
dc contract sign-request \
  --offering-id <offering-id> \
  --identity my-user \
  --requester-ssh-pubkey "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3..." \
  --requester-contact "https://github.com/username" \
  --memo "Project deployment" \
  --provider-pubkey-pem <provider-key> \
  --interactive
```

> The `--interactive` flag will prompt for any missing required information.

### Monitoring Contract Status

Check open contract requests:

```bash
dc contract list-open
```

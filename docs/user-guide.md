# User Guide

This guide covers everything you need to know about using the Decent Cloud platform as a user.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Completed [installation](installation.md)
- Generated identity and registered account
- Initial DC tokens for operations

### Registration

```bash
dc user register --identity my-user
```

## Finding Resources

### Listing All Offerings

```bash
dc offering list
```

### Searching Specific Offerings

Use the query command with specific criteria:

```bash
dc offering query 'memory >= 512MB AND storage.size > 1gb'
```

Common search criteria:

- Memory: `memory >= <size>`
- Storage: `storage.size > <size>`
- CPU: `cpu.cores >= <number>`
- Location: `location == "<region>"`

### Understanding Offerings

Key aspects to consider:

1. Resource specifications
2. Provider reputation
3. Pricing
4. Location
5. Terms of service

## Contracting Resources

### Preparing for Contract

1. Review provider's profile and history:

```bash
dc provider list --balances
```

2. Ensure sufficient token balance
3. Prepare SSH public key
4. Have contact information ready

### Creating a Contract Request

Basic contract request:

```bash
dc contract sign-request \
  --offering-id <offering-id> \
  --identity my-user \
  --requester-ssh-pubkey "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3..." \
  --requester-contact "https://github.com/username" \
  --memo "Project deployment" \
  --provider-pubkey-pem <provider-key> \
  --interactive
```

> The `--interactive` flag will prompt for any missing required information.

### Monitoring Contract Status

Check open contract requests:

```bash
dc contract list-open
```

## Managing Resources

### Resource Management in Decent Cloud

1. **Ledger Synchronization**

   - Regularly sync your local ledger: `dc ledger-remote fetch`
   - This ensures you have the latest contract and provider information
   - Essential for accurate balance and status checks

2. **Token Balance Management**

   - Monitor your DC token balance before making contract requests
   - Check registration fees: `dc ledger-remote get-registration-fee`
   - Maintain sufficient tokens for contract operations

3. **Contract Monitoring**

   - Track active contracts with `dc contract list-open`
   - Verify provider reputation before contracting: `dc provider list --balances`
   - Keep records of contract terms and communication

## Token Management

### Checking Balance

```bash
dc ledger-remote fetch
dc user balance --identity my-user
```

### Token Best Practices

- Maintain sufficient balance for operations
- Monitor transaction history
- Keep private keys secure
- Regular ledger synchronization

## Troubleshooting

### Platform-Specific Issues

1. **Ledger Sync Problems**

   - Force ledger sync: `dc ledger-remote fetch --force`
   - Check your internet connection to the Internet Computer network
   - Verify your identity is correctly configured

2. **Contract Request Issues**

   - Ensure you have sufficient DC tokens for registration fees
   - Verify your SSH public key format is correct
   - Check that provider offerings are active: `dc offering list`

3. **Identity and Authentication**

   - Confirm identity exists: `dc keygen --list`
   - Verify account registration: `dc user status --identity <your-id>`
   - Check Principal ID matches your expectations
